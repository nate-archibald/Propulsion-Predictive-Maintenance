# Deploy Databricks AppKit Applications

Deploy an AppKit project to Databricks Apps, verify it runs, and fix common errors.

## When to Use

- Deploying an AppKit app to Databricks Apps (first deploy or redeployment)
- Verifying a deployed app loads correctly
- Diagnosing and fixing deploy failures
- Freeing workspace app slots when the limit is reached

**Not for scaffolding.** Use `01-appkit-scaffold` to create a new project.
**Not for building features.** Use `02-appkit-build` to implement UI and backend code.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure:

- The app builds locally (`npm run build` succeeds)
- `$APP_NAME` and `$PROFILE` are set by the calling prompt. **If a `.vibecoding-state.md` exists from a prior phase**, use the `APP_NAME`, `PROFILE`, and workspace URL values from it directly — do not re-derive them with `databricks current-user me` or `databricks auth profiles`.
- The app directory contains `app.yaml` and `databricks.yml`
- If deploying to a **different workspace** than where the app was scaffolded: update the `host` in `databricks.yml`, update `sql_warehouse_id` for the new workspace, and remove stale bundle state with `rm -rf $APP_NAME/.databricks`
- If no CLI profile exists for the target workspace, create one per **[PRE-REQUISITES §11](../../../PRE-REQUISITES.md)** before deploying (the IDE/CLI auth path; it uses `auth login`, not the interactive `configure` flow that fails in automated/agent contexts). **IDE/CLI only** — on Genie Code the runtime is already authenticated to its host workspace; skip profile creation and drop `--profile` from every command (see the routing note below).
- All commands in this skill assume the working directory is `apps_lakebase/`. Paths like `$APP_NAME/app.yaml` are relative to `apps_lakebase/`, not the repo root. On Genie Code, this is `<repo-clone-root>/apps_lakebase/` under your `.assistant/skills/` clone — `cd` there first; never operate from `/tmp`.
- **Do NOT run `rm -f package-lock.json && npm install` locally before deploying.** The platform's `npm install` depends on lockfile stability; regenerating the lockfile locally causes `ENOTEMPTY` / `Exit handler never called` failures during platform install. See [references/lockfile-and-recreation.md](references/lockfile-and-recreation.md) for the full rule, scenario table, and recovery ladder — plus the Lakebase ownership consequences of app recreation.

### Working in Genie Code (deploy routing)

This skill is written for the **IDE/CLI path** — the commands below are correct as-is when you have a local terminal, Node.js, and a CLI profile. If you are running in **Genie Code** (no local toolchain, pre-authenticated to one workspace), apply these four substitutions to every step and you do not need to re-read this note per command:

| IDE/CLI (as written) | Genie Code substitution |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| `databricks <cmd> … --profile $PROFILE` | run `databricks <cmd> …` via `runDatabricksCli`, **omit `--profile`** (ambient auth) |
| `databricks apps deploy …` (when the project page blocks it) | SDK fallback via `executeCode`: `w.apps.deploy(<name>, AppDeployment(source_code_path=<workspace path>, mode=AppDeploymentMode.SNAPSHOT))` |
| `npm run build` / `npm run dev` (local) | **skip** — the frontend build runs server-side in the container during deploy; the build error is **not readable from compute** (`databricks apps logs <name>` → OAuth error) — read it at `<app-url>/logz` in a browser instead |
| `databricks bundle deploy` (targetless) | add `--target dev` (a targetless bundle deploy is guardrail-blocked on Genie Code) |

Everything else (config validation, log streaming, the fix loop, error table) is identical across clients. Inline `> **Client note — Genie Code:**` callouts below flag the few steps where the behavior — not just the syntax — differs. See `skills/genie-code-environment` for the full behavioral manifest.

## Before You Begin

**The upstream Databricks agent-skills repo and AppKit docs are the source of truth for deploy commands, platform rules, and options.**

- **Platform guide (SP permissions, runtime constraints, errors):** https://github.com/databricks/databricks-agent-skills/blob/main/skills/databricks-apps/references/platform-guide.md
- **App management:** https://databricks.github.io/appkit/docs/app-management
- **Configuration:** https://databricks.github.io/appkit/docs/configuration
- **AppKit docs (in-terminal):** `npx @databricks/appkit docs "app-management"`
- **CLI help:** `databricks apps deploy --help`

The bundled reference at [references/app-management.md](references/app-management.md) covers commonly used commands as a fallback when live docs cannot be reached.

> **Do NOT improvise workarounds.** If a deployment fails, check the app logs and match

### Platform Constraints (from platform-guide.md)

These runtime constraints affect deployment and troubleshooting:

- **Startup timeout:** App must start within 10 minutes (including dependency installation)
- **HTTP proxy timeout:** 120 seconds per request (not configurable; use WebSockets for long operations)
- **Max apps per workspace:** 100
- **Max file size:** 10 MB per file in bundle
- **Filesystem:** Ephemeral — no persistent local storage; use UC Volumes or Lakebase
- **No shell in `command`:** `app.yaml` `command` does not run in a shell; env vars outside `app.yaml` are inaccessible
- **Graceful shutdown:** SIGTERM → 15 seconds → SIGKILL
- **Logging:** Only stdout/stderr captured; file-based logs are lost on container recycle
- **Destructive updates:** `bundle run` / `apps update` does full replacement and can wipe OBO scopes

### Platform Build Pipeline

When `databricks apps deploy` pushes code to the platform, the following sequence runs inside the container:

1. **Download source** — workspace files are extracted into `/home/app/`
2. **`npm install`** — installs dependencies from `package.json` / `package-lock.json`. Runs in **production mode** (`NODE_ENV=production`), so `devDependencies` are skipped.
3. **`npm run build`** (if the `build` script exists) — compiles the project. `prebuild` hooks fire automatically before this step.
4. **Run `command`** — executes the `command` from `app.yaml` (e.g., `npm run start`)

**Hard timeout:** The entire sequence (steps 1-4) must complete within **10 minutes**. If npm install or build exceeds this, the deploy fails with `App process did not start within 10 minutes`.

**Critical rules:**

- **NEVER** add `preinstall` or `postinstall` scripts that modify `node_modules`. These create infinite loops or corrupt the install.
- **NEVER** add platform-detection conditionals (e.g., `[ "$HOME" = '/home/app' ]`) to skip build steps.
- **NEVER** modify the scaffold's `package.json` dependency versions, aliases, or overrides. If `rolldown-vite`, `@playwright/test`, or other packages were included by `databricks apps init`, leave them as-is — the scaffold is tested to deploy on the platform.
- **DO** let scaffolded `prebuild` hooks run (`appkit sync`, `appkit generate-types`). Warnings about `@ast-grep/napi` are harmless and guarded by `2>/dev/null; true`.
- **DO** note that `databricks bundle deploy` (and `databricks apps deploy` which calls it internally) uses `.gitignore` patterns for file exclusion — NOT `.databricksignore`.

**Authoritative source:** [Databricks Apps deploy — deployment logic](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/deploy) and [post-deployment behavior](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/app-runtime).

> **Client note — Genie Code (verified):** because this build pipeline runs **server-side in the container**, a Genie Code user with **no local npm** can deploy by editing source directly in the workspace and triggering a deployment via the SDK — `w.apps.deploy(<name>, AppDeployment(source_code_path=<workspace path>, mode=AppDeploymentMode.SNAPSHOT))`. This was tested end-to-end: editing an un-built `client/src/App.tsx` and redeploying produced deploy status `Building app…` and the edited string appeared in the **server-built** JS bundle (`/assets/index-*.js`). No local `npm install`/`npm run build` and no pre-synced `dist/` are required on Genie Code.

### Package Lock Management

The platform's `npm install` depends on `package-lock.json` stability. Scenario table:

| Lockfile state | Platform behavior | Action |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Present, matches platform cache | Fast install | Deploy |
| Regenerated locally with foreign registry URLs | Mixed URLs → `ENOTEMPTY` / `Exit handler never called` after ~3 min | Revert or delete lockfile, redeploy |
| Absent | Fresh resolve, slower but succeeds | Acceptable for first deploy |
| Refreshed via `npm install --package-lock-only` | Keeps lockfile coherent, no tarball install | Preferred when bumping dep versions |

> **NEVER run `rm -f package-lock.json && npm install` locally before deploying.** The regenerated lockfile picks up your local npm proxy URLs, breaking platform install. If you must refresh, use `--package-lock-only`, or delete the lockfile and let the platform resolve.

> **Client note — Genie Code:** the "Absent → acceptable for first deploy" row does **NOT** apply on the SDK SNAPSHOT path. With no `package-lock.json`, the deploy **hard-fails at the source-export phase in ~10s** (`RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST`), before `npm install` runs — so the lockfile is a **hard requirement**, not optional. Never delete it as a "reset"; change deps by editing `package.json` and keeping the lockfile consistent.

Full recovery ladder + prevention rules: [references/lockfile-and-recreation.md](references/lockfile-and-recreation.md).

### App Deletion Is Destructive (Lakebase Ownership)

Deleting and recreating a Databricks App assigns a **new Service Principal UUID**. Lakebase schemas owned by the old SP become inaccessible (`permission denied for schema`, `must be owner of table`) even though `psql` as admin still sees them.

Fix, as workspace admin via `databricks psql`:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS <schema_name> CASCADE;
-- Then redeploy — the new SP's DDL will recreate and own the schema.
```

Prevention: avoid app deletion. If deploys are broken, use the lockfile recovery ladder first. App deletion is a last resort.

---

## Step 1: Validate Configuration

Verify `app.yaml` has a startup command:

```bash
grep -E "build/index\.mjs|npm.*start" $APP_NAME/app.yaml
```

Accepted patterns:

- `command: ['npm', 'run', 'start']` — AppKit default (scaffold output)
- `command: [node, build/index.mjs]` — legacy / alternative

If using `npm run start`, verify the `start` script in `package.json` points to the correct built output (e.g., `node dist/server.js`).

If no startup command is present, add the default:

```yaml
command:
  - npm
  - run
  - start
```

Check that required environment bindings are present. At minimum, apps using the analytics plugin need:

```bash
grep "DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID" $APP_NAME/app.yaml
```

You should see `valueFrom: sql-warehouse`. If missing, add it:

```yaml
env:
  - name: DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID
    valueFrom: sql-warehouse
```

The calling prompt may require additional plugin-specific env vars (e.g., `LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT` for Lakebase). Validate those before proceeding.

Verify `databricks.yml` references the correct `$APP_NAME`:

```bash
grep "name:" $APP_NAME/databricks.yml | head -2
```

Note: The AppKit scaffold does not include a `name:` field in `app.yaml` — the app name is defined only in `databricks.yml` under `bundle.name` and `resources.apps`.

Run the AppKit validator to check `app.yaml` schema, resource bindings, and manifest validity:

```bash
cd $APP_NAME && databricks apps validate --profile $PROFILE
```

Fix any reported errors before proceeding.

> **Client note — Genie Code:** `databricks apps validate` is **hard-blocked** via `runDatabricksCli` (not allow-listed). Skip this gate on Genie Code. The platform runs the same validation server-side during the build pipeline, but those build logs are **not readable from compute** — `databricks apps logs <name>` returns an OAuth-token error. Read the authoritative schema/compile signal at **`<app-url>/logz` in a browser** (where you are already authenticated) instead.

**Cross-validate `valueFrom` references against `databricks.yml` resources.** Every `valueFrom:` in `app.yaml` must have a matching resource declaration in `databricks.yml`. If not, `databricks apps deploy` (which runs `bundle deploy` internally) will fail to resolve the resource and the env var will be empty at runtime.

```bash
for ref in $(grep 'valueFrom:' $APP_NAME/app.yaml | awk '{print $2}'); do
  if ! grep -q "$ref" $APP_NAME/databricks.yml 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "ERROR: app.yaml references valueFrom: $ref but no matching resource in databricks.yml"
    echo "  bundle deploy will strip manually-attached resources. Add the resource to databricks.yml."
  fi
done
```

This catches the common failure where Lakebase `postgres` resources were attached via REST API or `databricks apps update` but not declared in `databricks.yml` — `bundle deploy` resets the resource list on every deploy, stripping anything not in the bundle config.

**Check for Lakebase project conflicts with bundle declarations.** If `databricks.yml` declares `postgres_projects` and the project already exists, the correct action depends on who created it:

- **Bundle created it** (Phase 1 deploy already ran, `.databricks/` state exists): **Keep `postgres_projects`.** Terraform state tracks it. Phase 2 redeploy is idempotent. See `04-appkit-plugin-add/references/plugin-lakebase.md` for Phase 2 binding instructions.
- **Created outside the bundle** (CLI, UI, or different bundle; no `.databricks/` state): **Remove `postgres_projects`** and skip to Phase 2 binding. Terraform has no state for it.

> **CRITICAL: Never remove `postgres_projects` from `databricks.yml` after a bundle deploy has created the project.** Removing a Terraform-tracked resource declaration tells `bundle deploy` to destroy the resource. This causes a cascading failure: project destroyed → re-adding hits soft-delete retention ("already exists" for ~5-10 min) → manual recreation required outside the bundle.

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(grep -A2 'postgres_projects:' $APP_NAME/databricks.yml | grep 'project_id:' | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d "'" | tr -d '"')
if [ -n "$PROJECT_ID" ]; then
  EXISTS=$(databricks postgres list-projects --profile $PROFILE --output json 2>/dev/null \
    | jq -e --arg pid "$PROJECT_ID" '[.[] | select(.name | contains($pid))] | length > 0' 2>/dev/null)
  BUNDLE_STATE=$(test -d "$APP_NAME/.databricks" && echo "true" || echo "false")
  if [ "$EXISTS" = "true" ] && [ "$BUNDLE_STATE" = "true" ]; then
    echo "OK: Lakebase project '$PROJECT_ID' exists and is tracked by this bundle. Keep postgres_projects."
  elif [ "$EXISTS" = "true" ] && [ "$BUNDLE_STATE" = "false" ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Lakebase project '$PROJECT_ID' exists but is NOT tracked by this bundle."
    echo "  Remove postgres_projects from databricks.yml to avoid 'already exists' Terraform errors."
    echo "  Keep only app.resources.postgres binding."
  fi
fi
```

---

## Step 2: Build

Run `npm run build` locally to catch TypeScript and compilation errors early. The deploy pipeline rebuilds on the platform, but catching errors locally avoids a slow deploy-fail-fix cycle.

```bash
cd $APP_NAME
npm run build
```

This must complete without errors. A successful build produces the output referenced by `app.yaml`'s command (typically `build/index.mjs` or `dist/server.js`).

> **Client note — Genie Code:** this local pre-build is an **IDE/CLI convenience**, not a hard gate — there is no local Node toolchain on Genie Code. **Skip Step 2 entirely** and deploy directly (Step 3); the platform runs the same `npm install` + `npm run build` **server-side** during the deploy pipeline. TypeScript/compile errors do **NOT** come back through `databricks apps logs <name>` (it returns an OAuth error from compute); they appear only at **`<app-url>/logz` in a browser** — read the exact `error TS…` line there and feed it into the Step 5 fix loop. Because there is no local `tsc`/`npm` to catch them first, run the import-specifier grep gate (see the `99-deploy_databricks_app.genie-code.md` fork, Step 2b) before deploying. (Build-runs-server-side was verified end-to-end — see the Platform Build Pipeline note above.)

Verify the build output exists before deploying:

```bash
ls build/index.mjs 2>/dev/null || ls dist/server.js 2>/dev/null || echo "WARNING: No build output found — check app.yaml command"
```

If there are TypeScript or build errors, fix them before proceeding.

### Fixing TS6133 (Unused Import/Variable) Errors

These are the most common build errors at deploy time. Before removing any symbol:

1. **Grep the full file** for each symbol name — do not rely on reading only the import section.
2. **If the import has other used names**, remove only the unused name from the import list.
3. **If ALL names from a module are unused**, delete the entire import line. Never produce `import {} from "..."` — this is a side-effect import that loads the module for nothing.
4. **If the error is on a variable declaration** (e.g., `const navigate = useNavigate()`), remove both the declaration and its import.

After fixes, run the linter on edited files before rebuilding.

---

## Step 3: Deploy

Before running the deploy, verify the lockfile has not been regenerated locally — a regenerated lockfile will often fail on the platform with `ENOTEMPTY` after ~3 minutes:

```bash
cd $APP_NAME
test -f package-lock.json && git diff --quiet -- package-lock.json \
  || echo "WARN: package-lock.json modified locally; review references/lockfile-and-recreation.md before deploy"
```

If the warning fires, read [references/lockfile-and-recreation.md](references/lockfile-and-recreation.md) and apply the recovery ladder (revert → delete → `--package-lock-only` refresh) before proceeding.

Deploy using the AppKit CLI pipeline — a single command that builds the frontend, syncs code to the workspace via bundle deploy, and starts the app:

```bash
cd $APP_NAME
databricks apps deploy --profile $PROFILE
```

This is equivalent to running `npm run build` + `databricks bundle deploy` + `databricks apps start` in sequence.

> **Client note — Genie Code:** run `databricks apps deploy` (no `--profile`) through `runDatabricksCli` from the `$APP_NAME` directory. If the project page blocks `apps deploy`, use the SDK fallback via `executeCode` — `w.apps.deploy(<name>, AppDeployment(source_code_path=<workspace path>, mode=AppDeploymentMode.SNAPSHOT))` — which triggers the same server-side build (no pre-synced `dist/` needed). Then poll `w.apps.get(<name>)` for the `Building app…` → `ACTIVE` transition; on `FAILED`, read the build error at `<app-url>/logz` in a browser (`databricks apps logs <name>` returns an OAuth error from compute).

For faster iteration after the first deploy, skip the build step:

```bash
databricks apps deploy --skip-build --profile $PROFILE
```

> **Resource-sensitive deploys:** `databricks apps deploy` runs `bundle deploy` internally, which resets the app's resource list to match `databricks.yml`. If resources were added outside the bundle (e.g., via REST API), a bundle deploy removes them. In that case, sync code first with `databricks bundle deploy --profile $PROFILE`, then trigger a run separately with `databricks apps deploy --profile $PROFILE` (which rebuilds from the already-synced workspace source without resetting resources). If no code changes are needed, skip redeployment entirely.

For Lakebase Autoscaling, use `postgres_project`/`postgres_branch`/`postgres_endpoint` resources (CLI v0.287.0+) if you want bundle-managed project lifecycle. For Lakebase Provisioned, use `database_instance` + `app.resources[].database` (CLI v0.265.0+). Do not mix the two models.

Wait for completion — typically 1-3 minutes for redeployments, 3-5 minutes for first deploys. Do not treat longer waits as failures until 7+ minutes have elapsed.

Verify the app is running before proceeding:

```bash
databricks apps get $APP_NAME --output json --profile $PROFILE | jq '{status: .status.state, compute: .compute_status.state}'
```

> **Note:** `status.state` may be `null` for up to 60 seconds after deployment even when the app is healthy. The definitive health signal is `compute_status.state: "ACTIVE"` plus clean logs showing the server is listening. If `compute` is `ACTIVE` but `status` is `null`, the app is running — proceed to Step 4.

If `compute` is not `ACTIVE`, wait 30 seconds and re-check. Use `databricks apps logs $APP_NAME --follow --profile $PROFILE` to stream logs in real-time instead of polling repeatedly.

---

## Step 4: Verify UI Loads

Run the verification script — it handles polling, retries, and health checks in one call:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-deploy.sh $APP_NAME $PROFILE
```

Exit code 0 = healthy. Exit code 1 = still starting (wait 30s, re-run). Exit code 2 = error (proceed to Step 5).

**Manual fallback** (only if `scripts/verify-deploy.sh` does not exist):

```bash
APP_URL=$(databricks apps get $APP_NAME --output json --profile $PROFILE | jq -r '.url')
echo "App URL: $APP_URL"
```

Open `$APP_URL` in a browser. You should see the React application — not an error page or JSON.

If the page shows an error or doesn't load, proceed to Step 5.

---

## Testing Deployed App APIs

Databricks Apps require authentication for all API requests. Generate a bearer token before testing:

```bash
TOKEN=$(databricks auth token --profile $PROFILE | jq -r '.access_token')
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$APP_URL/api/health" | jq .
```

If `curl` returns HTML (a login page) or 401, the token has expired. Re-run the `TOKEN=...` line to refresh it. Tokens are short-lived (~1 hour).

> **Client note — Genie Code:** `databricks auth token` is **hard-blocked** via `runDatabricksCli`, and a raw `Authorization: Bearer` header (even from SDK `w.config.token`) is **rejected by AppKit's OAuth middleware** (`/api/health` → `401`; `/` → `302`). Two working ways to test a deployed app from Genie Code:
>
> 1. **Browser (simplest manual verify):** open the app URL (SDK `w.apps.get(<name>).url`) — the Databricks Apps OAuth flow establishes the session automatically. Confirm the React UI actually renders (a green deploy with a client-side runtime crash still shows a blank/error page — the scaffold's `ErrorBoundary` surfaces the stack). For backend/build logs, open `<app-url>/logz` in the same browser; `databricks apps logs <name>` returns an OAuth error from Genie compute.
> 2. **Programmatic (`executeCode`, for automated `/api/*` testing):** replay the 3-hop Apps OAuth handshake in **one `requests.Session()`** so the CSRF cookie persists (PKCE match), then reuse the session for all calls:
>    ```python
>    import requests
>    from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
>    w = WorkspaceClient(); app_url = w.apps.get("<name>").url
>    s = requests.Session()
>    r1 = s.get(app_url, allow_redirects=False)                                  # __Host-databricksapps_csrf cookie
>    r2 = s.get(r1.headers["location"],                                          # Databricks OIDC authorize
>               headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {w.config.token}"}, allow_redirects=False)
>    s.get(r2.headers["location"])                                               # /.auth/callback → session cookie
>    print(s.get(f"{app_url}/api/health").status_code)                          # now authenticated
>    ```
>    The single Session must carry the CSRF cookie through all 3 hops or the callback returns `403`.

---

## Step 5: Check Logs and Fix Errors (up to 3 iterations)

Stream the app logs:

```bash
databricks apps logs $APP_NAME --tail-lines 100 --profile $PROFILE
```

If errors exist:

1. Identify the error from the log output
2. Apply the fix in the app directory
3. Redeploy: `databricks apps deploy --profile $PROFILE`
   - For config-only changes (e.g., `app.yaml` or `databricks.yml`): `databricks apps deploy --skip-build --profile $PROFILE`
4. Check logs again

If no errors: deployment is successful.

Repeat up to 3 times. If errors persist after 3 attempts, report them for manual investigation.

> **Client note — Genie Code (fix loop):** Step 1 above (`databricks apps logs`) does **not** work — it returns an OAuth error from compute, and the SDK/REST `deployment.status.message` only says "check /logz". On `FAILED`, route to the **`/logz`-human loop**: print `<app-url>/logz`, have the operator open it (already authenticated) and paste back the exact `error TS…`/Vite line, fix that file:line, and redeploy. If no browser is available, use the **2–3-file batch ladder** (revert to the last `SUCCEEDED` source, re-apply changes 2–3 files at a time, redeploy after each ~50s batch; the batch that flips green→`FAILED` holds the break). See the `99-deploy_databricks_app.genie-code.md` fork Steps 2b/3 for the full procedure.

> **Before diagnosing errors:** Run `npx @databricks/appkit docs "app-management"` and `databricks apps deploy --help` for the latest CLI options and deployment behavior. These are the source of truth for deploy commands.

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Cannot find module 'build/index.mjs'` | Build output missing or `app.yaml` command wrong | Verify `app.yaml` command matches the build output (see Step 1) and `npm run build` succeeds |
| `DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID is not set` | Analytics plugin can't find the warehouse | Add `valueFrom: sql-warehouse` for `DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID` in `app.yaml` |
| Connection refused / timeout on SQL queries | SQL warehouse starting up or stopped | Wait 30s and retry; check warehouse is running in the workspace |
| TypeScript / build errors during deploy | Compilation issues in `server/` or `client/` | Run `npm run build` locally, fix errors, redeploy |
| `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `@databricks/appkit` | Dependencies not installed | Verify `package.json` lists `@databricks/appkit` and `@databricks/appkit-ui`; redeploy |
| `databricks apps restart` -> command not found | `restart` subcommand does not exist | Always redeploy: `databricks apps deploy --profile $PROFILE`. There is no restart command. |
| App loses resources after `stop` then `start` | `stop`/`start` cycle detaches manually-attached resources (e.g., postgres) | Avoid `stop`/`start` for apps with non-bundle resources. Redeploy instead. |
| `databricks api put/patch` with complex JSON silently fails | The CLI `api` subcommand does not reliably handle nested JSON payloads | Use `curl` with bearer token for REST API calls that require complex JSON bodies |
| `error resolving resource postgres for env LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT: resource postgres not found` | `app.yaml` uses `valueFrom: postgres` but no `postgres` resource declared in `databricks.yml`; `bundle deploy` stripped manually-attached resources | Add `postgres_project`/`postgres_branch`/`postgres_endpoint` resources to `databricks.yml` app definition; see `05-appkit-lakebase-wiring` skill prerequisites |
| `app.yaml` syntax / validation error | Invalid YAML or bad `valueFrom` reference | Run `databricks apps validate --profile $PROFILE` to diagnose |
| Env vars not available at startup | `command` does not run in a shell; env vars outside `app.yaml` are inaccessible | Define all needed variables in `app.yaml`'s `env` section |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` after deploy | SP missing permissions on declared resources | Ensure resources in `databricks.yml` have `permission` field; platform auto-grants on deploy |
| `File is larger than 10485760 bytes` | Bundled file exceeds 10 MB limit | Use `requirements.txt`/`package.json` for deps; do not bundle large artifacts |
| 504 Gateway Timeout | Request exceeded 120s proxy timeout | Use WebSockets for long operations; SSE may be buffered |
| OBO scopes missing after deploy | `apps update` / `bundle run` does full replacement, can wipe scopes | Re-apply OBO scopes after each deploy that modifies resources |
| `project with such id already exists in the workspace` | Lakebase project was recently deleted; platform has ~5-10 min soft-delete retention | Wait 5-10 min for retention to expire, then retry. Or create the project manually via `databricks postgres create-project` with a different project ID. If using bundle, clear `.databricks/` state before retry. |
| `Failed to create role for SP... NOT_FOUND: project id not found` | `postgres_projects` was removed from `databricks.yml`, causing Terraform to destroy the project | Re-add `postgres_projects` to `databricks.yml`. If the project ID is stuck in soft-delete, wait 5-10 min or create manually via CLI. See the Lakebase project conflict check in Step 1. |
| `ENOTEMPTY: directory not empty, rmdir '.../node_modules/<pkg>'` or `Exit handler never called` during platform `Installing packages...` | `package-lock.json` regenerated locally (e.g., after switching npm registries or running `rm -f package-lock.json && npm install`), producing mixed registry URLs the platform cache cannot satisfy | Revert the lockfile (`git checkout -- package-lock.json`); if that isn't possible, delete the lockfile and redeploy for a fresh platform resolve. Full recovery ladder + prevention rule in [references/lockfile-and-recreation.md](references/lockfile-and-recreation.md). |
| `permission denied for schema <name>` (or `relation does not exist`) after deleting and recreating the app | Recreated app got a new SP UUID; Lakebase schemas are still owned by the old SP | DROP + recreate affected schemas as a workspace admin so the new SP owns them. Detailed steps in [references/lockfile-and-recreation.md](references/lockfile-and-recreation.md) (Rule 2). |
| `unknown field: endpoint_name` / `missing required field: name` from `databricks bundle validate` | `serving_endpoint` app resource in `databricks.yml` uses `endpoint_name` — the schema field is `name` | Rename to `name:` in the `serving_endpoint` block. See [04-appkit-plugin-add/references/plugin-serving.md](../04-appkit-plugin-add/references/plugin-serving.md) ("Add Serving Endpoint as App Resource") for the correct snippet. |

The calling prompt may define additional plugin-specific errors (e.g., Lakebase connection or permission errors). Check those if the errors above don't match.

## If the Workspace App Limit Is Reached

If deployment fails because the workspace has hit its app limit, do NOT rename your app. Instead, free up a slot by removing the oldest stopped app:

Find the oldest stopped app:

```bash
OLDEST=$(databricks apps list -o json --profile $PROFILE | jq -r '[.[] | select(.compute_status.state == "STOPPED")] | sort_by(.update_time) | .[0] | .name // empty')
if [ -z "$OLDEST" ]; then
  echo "No stopped apps to delete. Manual workspace cleanup needed."
else
  echo "Deleting oldest stopped app: $OLDEST"
  databricks apps delete "$OLDEST" --profile $PROFILE
  sleep 10
fi
```

Retry the deployment.

If the limit error persists, repeat with the next oldest stopped app — but stop after 3 total attempts (increase the wait to 20s, then 40s between retries). If it still fails after 3 tries, stop and report the issue for manual workspace cleanup. Never delete apps in RUNNING state.
