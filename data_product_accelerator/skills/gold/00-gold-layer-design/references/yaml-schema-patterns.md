# YAML Schema Patterns

Extracted from `context/prompts/03a-gold-layer-design-prompt.md` Step 3. Use alongside the `01-yaml-table-setup` and `06-table-documentation` skills.

## Directory Structure (Domain-Organized)

```
gold_layer_design/yaml/
├── location/                 # 🏪 Location domain
│   ├── dim_store.yaml
│   ├── dim_region.yaml
│   └── dim_territory.yaml
├── product/                  # 📦 Product domain
│   ├── dim_product.yaml
│   ├── dim_brand.yaml
│   └── dim_category.yaml
├── time/                     # 📅 Time domain
│   ├── dim_date.yaml
│   └── dim_fiscal_period.yaml
├── sales/                    # 💰 Sales domain
│   ├── fact_sales_daily.yaml
│   └── dim_promotion.yaml
├── inventory/                # 📊 Inventory domain
│   ├── fact_inventory_snapshot.yaml
│   └── dim_warehouse.yaml
└── README.md                 # Domain index
```

**Rules:**
- Each table belongs to exactly ONE domain
- YAML folder name matches domain name in ERDs
- Conformed dimensions (date, geography) get own domain
- Facts go to domain of their primary business measure

## Dimension YAML Template (SCD Type 2)

**File: `gold_layer_design/yaml/{domain}/dim_store.yaml`**

```yaml
# Table metadata

  Business: Maintains complete store lifecycle history including address changes,

## Unknown Member Row Specification

Every dimension that is referenced by a `nullable: true` FK in any fact table MUST declare an `unknown_member:` block. This is the sentinel row that fact loads write when the source system has a NULL, empty string, or unresolvable business key — it lets joins stay inner joins and keeps measures correct.

**Rule:** If a fact YAML has `foreign_keys: - columns: [...] references: dim_X(...) nullable: true`, then `dim_X` MUST define `unknown_member:`.

**Template (add near the top of the dimension YAML, typically right after `table_properties:` and before `columns:`):**

```yaml
unknown_member:
  description: "Sentinel row for NULL or missing FK references from fact tables."
  key_value: "-1"            # surrogate key placeholder used by fact loads
  business_key_value: -1     # business-key placeholder; use -1 / 'UNKNOWN' per column type
  attribute_defaults:
    name: "Unknown"          # every text attribute gets a safe default
    status: "Not Applicable"
    # ... one entry per non-key attribute, using safe defaults (never NULL in the unknown row)
```

**Why this lives in the YAML:** the unknown-member contract is a design-time decision, not a runtime artifact. The Phase 8 validator checks this block exists for every dimension whose surrogate key is the target of a `nullable: true` FK. The Gold implementation stage (stage 4) reads `unknown_member` to generate the seed INSERT that populates the sentinel row before any fact load runs.

**Default conventions:**
- `key_value: "-1"` for STRING surrogate keys (hashed keys), `-1` for BIGINT surrogate keys.
- `name` / label-like attributes default to `"Unknown"`.
- Status / enum-like attributes default to `"Not Applicable"`.
- Dates default to `1900-01-01` (unknown) or `9999-12-31` (perpetual future), not NULL.

## Date Dimension YAML Template

**`population_strategy` (required for every table).** Each YAML declares how the Gold pipeline populates the table:
- `population_strategy: merge_from_silver` — the default for any Silver-sourced table; the Gold pipeline MERGEs from the Silver source named in lineage.
- `population_strategy: generate_sequence` — for generated dimensions with no Silver source (`dim_date`, and `dim_time` if present); the Gold pipeline INSERTs from a generated sequence instead of attempting a MERGE. Omitting this on a generated dimension causes the Gold pipeline to fail trying to read a non-existent Silver source.

**File: `gold_layer_design/yaml/time/dim_date.yaml`**

```yaml
table_name: dim_date
domain: time
