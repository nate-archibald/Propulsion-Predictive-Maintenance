> **End-to-end semantic layer?** If you are creating Metric Views as part of a larger deployment that also includes TVFs and Genie Spaces, read `semantic-layer/00-semantic-layer-setup/SKILL.md` first — it orchestrates this skill with the others and mandates Gold schema validation before artifact creation.

# Metric Views Patterns for Genie & AI/BI

## Overview

Metric Views provide a semantic layer for natural language queries via Genie and AI/BI dashboards. This skill standardizes the YAML structure for comprehensive, LLM-friendly metric definitions following Databricks Metric View Specification v1.1.

**Predecessor:** Gold tables must exist before creating metric views. Use `gold-layer-design` + `gold-layer-setup` skills first.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Create metric views with proper SQL syntax (`WITH METRICS LANGUAGE YAML`)
- Validate schemas before deployment to prevent 100% of common errors
- Structure joins (direct and snowflake schema patterns)
- Optimize comments for Genie natural language queries
- Handle SCD2 dimensions with proper `is_current` filtering

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating new metric views for Genie Spaces
- Troubleshooting metric view creation errors
- Validating schema references before deployment
- Implementing joins (including transitive relationships)
- Optimizing metric views for Genie natural language queries
- Ensuring compliance with v1.1 specification
- Following the requirements gathering template to design metric views

## Prerequisites

⚠️ **MANDATORY:** Complete these before creating metric views:
- [ ] Gold layer tables exist in Unity Catalog (use `gold-layer-design` + `gold-layer-setup` skills) — required for **production deployment**.
- [ ] Gold layer YAML schemas exist in `gold_layer_design/yaml/` (for validation script). When invoked from a workshop-draft plan with `selected_layer = gold_design`, YAML alone is acceptable as the source of truth and the validation script's live-catalog probe is advisory.
- [ ] Serverless SQL warehouse available (for metric view creation and querying)
- [ ] SQL warehouse or compute resource on Databricks Runtime 17.3+ (current docs requirement for `CAN USE` permission to create or edit a metric view). YAML v1.1 features were introduced in DBR 17.2; some experimental features (snowflake schema joins, agent metadata, materialization) require DBR 17.3+.

> **Layer-aware deployment (workshop mode):** The patterns in this skill (YAML, dimensions, measures, joins) are layer-neutral. The orchestrator (`semantic-layer/00-semantic-layer-setup`) decides which schema to deploy against based on `planning_source.selected_layer`:
>
> - `deployed_gold` / `gold_design` → reference Gold tables (production path).
> - `deployed_silver` / `deployed_bronze` (workshop deployments) → reference Silver or Bronze tables directly. Metric View YAML is identical in shape; the `source` field points at the workshop layer's schema. The orchestrator prints a quality advisory because raw layers typically lack curated COMMENTs and dimensional joins.
> - `source_csv` → not reached; the orchestrator stops because no live tables exist.
>
> Production Metric Views always reference Gold; workshop builds may reference Silver/Bronze and should be promoted to Gold for production hardening.

## MCP Tools (from upstream databricks-metric-views)

The `manage_metric_views` MCP tool supports all metric view operations:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `create` | Create a metric view with dimensions and measures |
| `alter` | Update a metric view's YAML definition |
| `describe` | Get the full definition and metadata |
| `query` | Query measures grouped by dimensions |
| `drop` | Drop a metric view |
| `grant` | Grant SELECT privileges to users/groups |

## Quick Start (2 hours)

**What You'll Create:**
1. `metric_views/{view_name}.yaml` — Semantic definitions (dimensions, measures, joins, formats)
2. `create_metric_views.py` — Script reads YAML, creates views with `WITH METRICS LANGUAGE YAML`
3. `metric_views_job.yml` — Asset Bundle job for deployment

**Deploy:** `databricks bundle deploy -t dev && databricks bundle run metric_views_job -t dev`

## Critical Rules

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Correct SQL Syntax

**Metric views MUST be created using `WITH METRICS LANGUAGE YAML` syntax:**

```python
create_sql = f"""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW {fully_qualified_name}
WITH METRICS
LANGUAGE YAML
COMMENT '{view_comment_escaped}'
AS $$
{yaml_str}
$$
"""
```

**Key Requirements:**
1. `WITH METRICS` — Identifies the view as a metric view
2. `LANGUAGE YAML` — Specifies YAML format
3. `AS $$ ... $$` — YAML content wrapped in dollar-quote delimiters
4. No SELECT statement — The YAML definition IS the view definition
5. `version` field — Must be included in each metric view YAML

**❌ WRONG:** Regular view with TBLPROPERTIES (creates regular VIEW, not METRIC_VIEW)

### ⚠️ Modifying: prefer `ALTER VIEW` over `CREATE OR REPLACE`

When **updating** an existing metric view, prefer `ALTER VIEW` — it preserves the view's Unity Catalog permissions (grants) and cascading metadata:

```sql
ALTER VIEW ${catalog}.${gold_schema}.<view_name>
AS $$
{updated_yaml}
$$
```

`CREATE OR REPLACE` (and the drop+create the deploy script uses by default) **deletes the view and therefore its grants and cascading metadata**. Only use replace/drop+create when a CI/CD step re-applies permissions on every deploy (e.g. via the `grant` action). For incremental edits to a live, governed view, always `ALTER`.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: v1.1 Unsupported Fields

**These fields will cause errors and MUST NOT be used:**

| Field | Error | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `name` | `Unrecognized field "name"` | ❌ NEVER include — name is in CREATE VIEW statement |
| `time_dimension` | `Unrecognized field "time_dimension"` | ❌ Remove entirely |
| `window_measures` | `Unrecognized field "window_measures"` | ❌ Remove the top-level `window_measures:` array. The per-measure `window:` property IS supported in v1.1 (Experimental status; `offset` requires DBR 18.1+). See `references/composability-patterns.md`. |
| `join_type` | Unsupported | ❌ Remove — defaults to LEFT OUTER JOIN |
| `table` (in joins) | `Missing required creator property 'source'` | ✅ Use `source` instead |

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Pre-Creation Schema Validation

**ALWAYS validate schemas BEFORE creating metric view YAML. 100% of deployment failures are preventable schema issues.**

**Schema Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Verified source table schema (ran DESCRIBE TABLE or checked YAML)
- [ ] Verified all joined table schemas
- [ ] Created column reference checklist for all tables
- [ ] Validated every dimension `expr` column exists
- [ ] Validated every measure `expr` column exists
- [ ] Validated join key columns exist in both tables
- [ ] Verified no transitive joins (all joins are source → table)
- [ ] For COUNT measures, verified primary key column exists
- [ ] For SCD2 joins, verified `is_current` column exists

See `references/validation-checklist.md` for detailed validation steps.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Source Table Selection

**Rule:** Revenue/bookings/transactions → FACT table. Property/host counts → DIMENSION table.

**❌ WRONG:** Revenue from dimension table (under-reports by 4x)
```yaml
source: ${catalog}.${schema}.dim_property  # ❌ Wrong for revenue!
```

**✅ CORRECT:** Revenue from fact table
```yaml
source: ${catalog}.${schema}.fact_booking_daily  # ✅ Correct for revenue!
```

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Transitive Join Limitations

**Metric Views DO NOT support transitive/chained joins** (where join B's `on` clause references join A instead of `source`).

**How to detect:** If ANY join's `on` clause references a join alias (not `source`), it is transitive and will fail.

**❌ WRONG:** Transitive join (join B references join A)
```yaml
joins:
  - name: dim_property                              # Join A
    source: catalog.schema.dim_property
    'on': source.property_id = dim_property.property_id
  - name: dim_destination                            # Join B
    source: catalog.schema.dim_destination
    'on': dim_property.destination_id = dim_destination.destination_id  # ❌ References dim_property!
```

This fails at plan-time with `UNRESOLVED_COLUMN` because `dim_property` is not visible in `dim_destination`'s `on` scope.

**✅ FIX 1 (Preferred — simplest): Use denormalized columns from existing dimension**

If `dim_property` already has `destination_name` and `destination_country`, reference them directly — no second join needed:
```yaml
# `fields:` is an alias for `dimensions:` introduced in DBR 18.1+; preserve whichever key the YAML already uses.
fields:
  - name: destination_name
    expr: dim_property.destination_name  # ✅ Already in dim_property
  - name: destination_country
    expr: dim_property.destination_country
```

**✅ FIX 2: Snowflake schema (nested joins) — requires DBR 17.1+**
```yaml
joins:
  - name: dim_property
    source: catalog.schema.dim_property
    'on': source.property_id = dim_property.property_id
    joins:  # ✅ Nested under dim_property — snowflake schema
      - name: dim_destination
        source: catalog.schema.dim_destination
        'on': dim_property.destination_id = dim_destination.destination_id
```

**Validation gate:** Before generating YAML, inspect all join `on` clauses. If the left side of any `on` references a join name (not `source`), restructure as nested joins or use denormalized columns.

**Pre-check for Fix 2 (nested joins):** Verify the workspace runtime supports nested joins:

```python
dbr = spark.sql("SELECT current_version()").first()[0]
assert float('.'.join(dbr.split('.')[:2])) >= 17.1, \
    f"Nested joins require DBR 17.1+, got {dbr}. Use Fix 1 or restructure."
```

**If Fix 1 is not feasible** (the intermediate dimension lacks the needed column, e.g., `dim_property` does not have `destination_name`), do NOT silently use Fix 2. Flag the constraint to the user and offer:
- (a) Add the column to the intermediate dimension in the Gold layer design
- (b) Confirm DBR 17.1+ and use nested joins
- (c) Omit the dimension from the Metric View and handle it via TVFs instead

See `references/advanced-patterns.md` for additional snowflake schema examples.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Multi-Hop / Snowflake Joins (subquery-source pattern)

Transitive joins aren't the only multi-hop trap. Two other shapes silently produce **wrong numbers** instead of a clean planner error — and both are indistinguishable from valid Metric Views on casual inspection. Treat this section as the canonical reference for any join that must traverse more than one dimension hop.

**Failure mode A (silent row-drop — DBR < 17.1):** Nested joins emitted under `joins:` are ignored by older runtimes. Aggregations run against the un-joined base, so dimensions from the nested table quietly disappear from the GROUP BY. No error surfaces — the Metric View just returns the wrong grain.

**Failure mode B (fan-out cartesian):** Nested joins work on DBR 17.1+ but the join key on the intermediate table (`dim_property.destination_id`) is **not unique**. Every row from `source` fans out over every matching `dim_destination` row, inflating measures. Again: no error — just a wrong total.

#### ❌ Anti-pattern 1 — flat "sibling" join relying on an earlier join's alias

```yaml
# Wrong: dim_destination is a sibling, not nested — and references dim_property.
joins:
  - name: dim_property
    source: catalog.schema.dim_property
    'on': source.property_id = dim_property.property_id
  - name: dim_destination
    source: catalog.schema.dim_destination
    'on': dim_property.destination_id = dim_destination.destination_id  # ❌ transitive
```

Planner behaviour:
- DBR ≥ 17.1: raises `UNRESOLVED_COLUMN` at creation time.
- DBR < 17.1: may silently accept and produce wrong results. **Never rely on the error.**

#### ❌ Anti-pattern 2 — nested join without verifying intermediate uniqueness

```yaml
joins:
  - name: dim_property
    source: catalog.schema.dim_property
    'on': source.property_id = dim_property.property_id
    joins:
      - name: dim_destination
        source: catalog.schema.dim_destination
        'on': dim_property.destination_id = dim_destination.destination_id
# ❌ Wrong if dim_property rows can share a destination_id with dim_destination M:1 ambiguity,
#    OR if dim_destination has multiple rows per destination_id (e.g. SCD2 without is_current filter).
```

Always verify uniqueness before shipping a nested join:

```sql
-- Intermediate table must be 1:1 on the OUTER-facing key:
SELECT property_id, COUNT(*) AS c
FROM catalog.schema.dim_property
GROUP BY property_id HAVING c > 1;  -- must return 0 rows

-- Inner dimension must be 1:1 on the join key (or filtered to is_current):
SELECT destination_id, COUNT(*) AS c
FROM catalog.schema.dim_destination
WHERE is_current = true              -- if SCD2
GROUP BY destination_id HAVING c > 1;  -- must return 0 rows
```

#### ✅ Correct pattern — subquery `source` (pre-join, then treat as one dim)

When nested joins are not available (DBR < 17.1) OR the intermediate table is not uniquely keyed, fold the multi-hop into a **subquery source** that pre-resolves the join off-Metric-View. The Metric View then joins `source` to a single, clean, uniquely-keyed dimension.

```yaml
source: catalog.schema.fact_booking_daily
joins:
  - name: dim_property_enriched
    # Subquery as source — pre-joins dim_property → dim_destination and enforces uniqueness.
    source: |
      (
        SELECT
          p.property_key,
          p.property_id,
          p.property_name,
          d.destination_id,
          d.destination_name,
          d.country
        FROM catalog.schema.dim_property p
        LEFT JOIN catalog.schema.dim_destination d
          ON p.destination_id = d.destination_id
         AND d.is_current = true        -- SCD2 guard
        WHERE p.is_current = true
      )
    'on': source.property_key = dim_property_enriched.property_key
fields:
  - name: property_name
    expr: dim_property_enriched.property_name
  - name: destination_name
    expr: dim_property_enriched.destination_name
  - name: country
    expr: dim_property_enriched.country
```

**Why this is the robust FALLBACK (use only when nested joins are unavailable — DBR < 17.1 — or the intermediate key is not unique):**
- Works on **every** DBR version (no 17.1 dependency).
- The subquery makes uniqueness guarantees explicit — reviewers can see and test them.
- Re-usable: wrap the subquery in a **Gold-layer VIEW** (`dim_property_enriched_v`) and reference it in every Metric View that needs the same enrichment — this also anchors the Gold dependency manifest (see `planning/00-project-planning/SKILL.md`).

> **Default preference (do not over-engineer):** on the workshop runtime (serverless, DBR ≥ 17.1) with 1:1 intermediate keys, **nested joins (Fix 2) are the PREFERRED multi-hop solution** — simpler, no extra Gold view, native to the Metric View. Reach for the subquery-source pattern only as the fallback. Do NOT spend planning cycles designing a subquery workaround when nested joins resolve the path directly.

**Decision ladder for any multi-hop requirement:**
1. Can the intermediate dimension carry the needed attribute directly (denormalize)? → Use Fix 1 (flat join, no second hop).
2. **PREFERRED on the workshop runtime.** Is every intermediate key uniquely 1:1 and is DBR ≥ 17.1? → Use nested joins (Fix 2) and document the uniqueness check in a comment.
3. Only if DBR < 17.1 OR an intermediate key is non-unique → use the **subquery-source fallback above**. Do NOT ship a transitive join and hope for an error.

**Anti-pattern detector — run before deploy:**

```python
import yaml, re
bad = []
for yf in Path("src/semantic/metric_views").rglob("*.yaml"):
    mv = yaml.safe_load(yf.read_text())
    joins = (mv.get("joins") or []) if isinstance(mv, dict) else []
    alias_names = {j["name"] for j in joins}
    for j in joins:
        on_clause = j.get("on", "")
        # Left side of `=` must start with `source.` or be a nested-join alias.
        m = re.match(r"\s*([A-Za-z_][\w.]*)", on_clause)
        left_head = (m.group(1).split(".", 1)[0] if m else "")
        if left_head in alias_names:
            bad.append((str(yf), j["name"], on_clause))
if bad:
    for f, n, o in bad:
        print(f"TRANSITIVE JOIN in {f} :: join '{n}' -> {o}")
    raise RuntimeError(
        "Transitive/flat-sibling joins detected. Restructure as nested "
        "joins (DBR 17.1+) or as subquery-source (preferred)."
    )
```

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Design (30 min)

**Read:** `references/requirements-template.md`

- [ ] Identify fact table as primary source
- [ ] List dimensions to join (2-5 dimension tables)
- [ ] Define key measures (5-10 measures with aggregation type)
- [ ] List common user questions (guides synonym creation)
- [ ] Map synonyms for each dimension and measure (3-5 each)

### Phase 2: YAML Creation (1 hour)

**Read:** `references/yaml-reference.md` and `references/advanced-patterns.md`

- [ ] Create one YAML file per metric view (filename = view name)
- [ ] Define `source` table (fully qualified with `${catalog}` and `${gold_schema}` placeholders)
- [ ] Add `joins` with `name`, `source`, `'on'` (include `is_current = true` for SCD2)
- [ ] Define dimensions with correct prefix (`source.` or `{join_name}.`)
  - [ ] Business-friendly comments and display names
  - [ ] 3-10 synonyms each (max 10 per field, max 255 chars each)
- [ ] Define measures with correct aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
  - [ ] Proper formatting (currency, number, percentage)
  - [ ] Comprehensive comments for Genie
  - [ ] 3-10 synonyms each (max 10 per field, max 255 chars each)

### Phase 3: Script & Bundle (30 min)

**Read:** `references/implementation-workflow.md`

- [ ] Validate YAML with `scripts/validate_metric_view.py`
- [ ] Use `scripts/create_metric_views.py` for deployment
- [ ] Configure Asset Bundle job (see `assets/templates/metric-views-job-template.yml`)
- [ ] Add YAML file sync to `databricks.yml`

### Phase 4: Deploy & Test (30 min)

**Read:** `references/validation-queries.md`

- [ ] Deploy: `databricks bundle deploy -t dev`
- [ ] Run: `databricks bundle run metric_views_job -t dev`
- [ ] Verify: `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` shows Type: METRIC_VIEW
- [ ] Test: `SELECT ... MEASURE(\`Total Revenue\`) ... GROUP BY ...`
- [ ] Test with Genie: Ask natural language questions

## Quick Reference

### YAML Structure (v1.1)

```yaml
version: "1.1"
comment: >
  PURPOSE: [One-line description]
  BEST FOR: [Question 1] | [Question 2] | [Question 3]
  NOT FOR: [What to avoid] (use [correct_asset] instead)
  DIMENSIONS: [dim1], [dim2], [dim3]
  MEASURES: [measure1], [measure2], [measure3]
  SOURCE: [fact_table] ([domain] domain)
  JOINS: [dim_table1] ([description])
  NOTE: [Critical caveats]

    'on': source.<fk> = <dim_table_alias>.<pk> AND <dim_table_alias>.is_current = true
    rely:
      at_most_one_match: true   # Optional. Many-to-one joins only — declares the join does not fan out, so the
                                # analyzer plans more efficiently. NOT validated at runtime: if it fans out,
                                # SUM/COUNT measures return wrong results. Omit if unsure.

# `fields:` is an alias for `dimensions:` (DBR 18.1+); preserve whichever key the YAML already uses.
# A metric view is valid with only dimensions, only measures, or both — measures are NOT mandatory.
# NOTE: the `materialization` block below still requires the `dimensions:` keyword.
fields:
  - name: <dimension_name>
    expr: source.<column>
    comment: <Business description>
    display_name: <User-Friendly Name>
    synonyms: [<alt1>, <alt2>]

measures:
  - name: <measure_name>
    expr: SUM(source.<column>)
    comment: <Business description>
    display_name: <User-Friendly Name>
    format:
      type: currency|number|percentage
      currency_code: USD
      decimal_places:
        type: exact|all
        places: 2
    synonyms: [<alt1>, <alt2>]
```

**Valid format types (exhaustive):**

| Type | Use For | Common Mistake |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `byte` | Data sizes (storage, memory) | — |
| `currency` | Monetary values (revenue, cost) | — |
| `date` | Date-only values | — |
| `date_time` | Timestamp values | — |
| `number` | Counts, averages, decimals, integers | ❌ `decimal`, ❌ `integer` |
| `percentage` | Ratios, rates, percentages | ❌ `percent` |

**⚠️ `percent` is NOT valid** (use `percentage`). **`decimal` is NOT valid** (use `number`).

### Column References

- **Main table columns:** Use `source.` prefix in all `expr` fields
- **Joined table columns:** Use join `name` as prefix (e.g., `dim_store.column_name`)
- **Never reference table names directly:** Use `source.` or `{join_name}.`

### Join Semantics

- Metric view joins use **LEFT OUTER JOIN** semantics by default — `source` (the fact) is the left side, joined dimension tables are the right side.
- Joins are **many-to-one by design**. If a join is actually many-to-many, the engine selects the **first matching row** from the dimension — silently wrong for aggregations. Keep joins many-to-one.
- The engine only joins tables **needed for the query** (based on the selected dimensions/measures), so unused joins add no cost.
- The optional `rely.at_most_one_match: true` hint lets the analyzer optimize filter pushdown for genuine many-to-one joins. It is **NOT validated at runtime** — if the join fans out, SUM/COUNT inflate. Verify cardinality before setting it (below).

**Cardinality verification (gate for `rely.at_most_one_match: true` and any join):**

```sql
-- The join key MUST be unique in the dimension table (0 rows = safe many-to-one).
SELECT <join_key>, COUNT(*) AS c
FROM ${catalog}.${gold_schema}.<dim_table>
WHERE is_current = true            -- include for SCD2 dimensions
GROUP BY <join_key>
HAVING c > 1;                       -- must return 0 rows
```

If this returns rows, the join can fan out: do not set `at_most_one_match`, filter to `is_current`, or pre-aggregate the dimension. A quick `COUNT(*)` before/after adding a join is the fastest fan-out smoke test — if the row count changes, you have a fan-out.

### Join Requirements

- Each join **MUST have** `name`, `source`, and either `'on'` or `using`
- `ON` clause: boolean expression using `source.` for main table, join name for joined table (quote the key: `'on'`). If a reference in an `on` clause has no prefix, it defaults to the joined table.
- `USING` clause: array of column names — use only when both tables share **identical** column names; use `on` for all other cases
- Each first-level join must reference `source` (NOT another join alias — that's transitive)
- For transitive relationships, use nested `joins:` (snowflake schema, DBR 17.1+) or denormalized columns; reference nested columns as `parent_join.child_join.column`
- SCD2 joins must include `AND {dim_table}.is_current = true`
- **MAP type columns are NOT supported** in joined tables

## Core Patterns

### Composability (MEASURE Function)

Metric views support **composability** — building complex metrics by referencing simpler measures via the `MEASURE()` function. Define atomic measures first, then compose derived KPIs:

```yaml
measures:
  - name: total_revenue
    expr: SUM(source.net_revenue)
  - name: order_count
    expr: COUNT(source.order_id)
  - name: avg_order_value
    expr: MEASURE(total_revenue) / MEASURE(order_count)  # ✅ Composed measure
```

**Measure-level filtering** with `FILTER` clause:
```yaml
  - name: fulfilled_orders
    expr: COUNT(1) FILTER (WHERE source.order_status = 'F')
  - name: fulfillment_rate
    expr: MEASURE(fulfilled_orders) / MEASURE(order_count)
    format:
      type: percentage
```

**Best practices:** Define atomic measures (SUM, COUNT, AVG) first; always use `MEASURE()` to reference other measures (never repeat the aggregation logic).

See `references/composability-patterns.md` for full guide including conditional logic, window measures (Experimental, supported in v1.1), and complete examples.

### Level of Detail (Percent-of-Total, Cohorts, Peer Averages)

Some metrics need an aggregate at a **different grain** than the query `GROUP BY` — percent-of-total, percent-of-category, cohort assignment, peer-average comparisons. A plain measure cannot do this because it always resolves at the query grain. Use a **Fixed LOD** (a dimension with `OVER (PARTITION BY ...)`, read with `ANY_VALUE()`) or an **Exclude LOD** (a window measure with `range: all`).

> ⚠️ **Do NOT compute percent-of-total with `MEASURE() / MEASURE()`** — both sides resolve at the query grain, so the ratio is always `1.0`. Use a Fixed LOD + `ANY_VALUE()`:

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG — always 1.0 (both operands at the query GROUP BY level)
- name: pct_wrong
  expr: MEASURE(`revenue`) / MEASURE(`total_revenue`)

# ✅ RIGHT — Fixed LOD dimension (global) + ANY_VALUE() in the measure
fields:
  - name: global_revenue
    expr: SUM(source.net_revenue) OVER ()      # ignores query GROUP BY
measures:
  - name: revenue
    expr: SUM(source.net_revenue)
  - name: pct_of_total
    expr: MEASURE(`revenue`) / ANY_VALUE(`global_revenue`)
    format: { type: percentage, decimal_places: { type: exact, places: 1 } }
```

See `references/level-of-detail.md` for Fixed vs Exclude LOD, percent-of-category, cohort analysis, and constraints.

### Standardized Comment Format (v3.0)

Use structured format for Genie optimization:

```yaml
comment: >
  PURPOSE: Comprehensive cost analytics for Databricks billing and usage analysis.
  
  BEST FOR: Total spend by workspace | Cost trend over time | SKU cost breakdown
  
  NOT FOR: Commit/contract tracking (use commit_tracking) | Real-time cost alerts
  
  DIMENSIONS: usage_date, workspace_name, sku_name, owner, tag_team
  
  MEASURES: total_cost, total_dbus, cost_7d, cost_30d
  
  SOURCE: fact_usage (billing domain)
  
  JOINS: dim_workspace (workspace details), dim_sku (SKU details)
  
  NOTE: Cost values are list prices. Actual billed amounts may differ.
```

### Dimension & Measure Patterns

See `references/advanced-patterns.md` for complete dimension patterns (geographic, product, time), measure patterns (revenue, count, percentage), and a full worked retail example.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Top 5 mistakes (with paired wrong/correct examples): wrong syntax (TBLPROPERTIES), unsupported fields (`time_dimension`, `window_measures`), wrong column references, including `name` in YAML, transitive joins.

See `references/advanced-patterns.md` for detailed wrong/correct code examples for each mistake.

## Python Script Error Handling

Key rules: strip `name` before `yaml.dump()`, drop existing VIEW/TABLE before CREATE, track failures and raise `RuntimeError`, verify METRIC_VIEW type via `DESCRIBE EXTENDED`.

See `scripts/create_metric_views.py` for the full working script and `references/implementation-workflow.md` for the detailed error handling patterns.

## Time Estimates

| Metric Views | Design | YAML Creation | Deploy & Test | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 view | 20 min | 30 min | 20 min | ~1 hour |
| 2-3 views | 30 min | 1 hour | 30 min | ~2 hours |
| 5+ views | 1 hour | 2 hours | 30 min | ~3.5 hours |

## Materialization (Experimental)

Metric views support optional materialization for pre-computed aggregations. Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines orchestrates materialized views, and the query optimizer automatically routes queries to the best materialized view using aggregate-aware query rewriting.

```yaml
materialization:
  schedule: every 6 hours
  mode: relaxed
  materialized_views:
    - name: baseline
      type: unaggregated
    - name: revenue_breakdown
      type: aggregated
      dimensions: [category, color]
      measures: [total_revenue]
```

**Materialized view types:** `unaggregated` (full data) and `aggregated` (pre-computed for specific dimension/measure combinations). Check refresh status with `DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED`.

Requires serverless compute enabled. Currently experimental — use for high-query-volume metric views where pre-computation reduces latency.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `SELECT *` not supported | Must explicitly list dimensions and use `MEASURE()` for measures |
| "Cannot resolve column" | Dimension/measure names with spaces need backtick quoting |
| JOIN at query time fails | Joins must be in the YAML definition, not in the SELECT query |
| `MEASURE()` required | All measure references must be wrapped: `MEASURE(\`name\`)` (or `agg()` on DBR 18.1+) |
| `HAVING` on a measure fails | Filter on the measure **alias**, not the `MEASURE()` expression |
| Redeploy dropped UC grants | `CREATE OR REPLACE`/drop+create deletes permissions — use `ALTER VIEW` to preserve them (see Critical Rules) |
| DBR version error | Compute must be on DBR 17.3+ to create or edit metric views (current docs requirement); YAML v1.1 features need 17.2+; legacy v0.1 needs 16.4+ |
| Materialization not working | Requires serverless compute enabled; currently experimental |

See `references/querying-metric-views.md` for the full query syntax guide (`GROUP BY ALL`, HAVING-on-alias, Top-K, casting, `agg()`).

## Version History

- **v5.2** (Jun 6, 2026) — Reconciled against the authoritative Databricks `using-metric-views` skill. Corrected window measures: they are supported in **v1.1** (Experimental), not "v0.1 only" — added `inclusive`/`exclusive` anchor modifiers and MTD example. Added `references/level-of-detail.md` (Fixed/Exclude LOD, percent-of-total via `ANY_VALUE()`, cohort) and `references/querying-metric-views.md` (`GROUP BY ALL`, HAVING-on-alias, Top-K, casting, `agg()` alias). Added join semantics (LEFT OUTER, many-to-one, first-matching-row), cardinality-verification query, and `ALTER VIEW` vs `CREATE OR REPLACE` governance (grant-preserving ALTER path in `create_metric_views.py`). Clarified `fields` is a DBR 18.1+ alias for `dimensions` and that measures are optional.
- **v5.1** (Apr 27, 2026) — Refreshed prerequisites and Common Issues for the current docs requirement (DBR 17.3+ for `CAN USE` on metric view creation/edit). Migrated External Documentation links and `upstream_sources` URLs to the current `/business-semantics/metric-views/...` paths (overview, yaml-reference, basic-modeling, advanced-techniques, manage, agent-metadata).
- **v5.0** (Feb 2026) — Expanded transitive joins with inline fixes; exhaustive format type table (6 types); composability (MEASURE function) patterns; FILTER clause; USING join clause; filter top-level field; window measures clarification (Experimental v0.1); materialization expansion; progressive disclosure restructure (Notes to Carry Forward + Next Step); 7 upstream_sources from official docs; new composability-patterns.md reference
- **v4.0** (Feb 2026) — Merged prompt content: Quick Start, implementation workflow, requirements template, creation script, validation queries, worked examples, common mistakes with paired examples
- **v3.0** (Dec 19, 2025) — Standardized structured comment format
- **v2.0** (Dec 16, 2025) — Genie optimization patterns from production post-mortem
- **v1.0** (Oct 2025) — Initial rule based on metric view deployment learnings

## Metric Views Notes to Carry Forward

After completing metric view creation, carry these notes to the next worker:
- **Metric View names and paths:** List of all created MVs with YAML file paths
- **Grain per view:** Which fact table sources each MV
- **Measure counts:** Number of dimensions and measures per MV
- **Validation status:** Which MVs passed schema validation, any unresolved issues
- **Composability notes:** Any composed measures using MEASURE() that downstream workers should know about

## Next Step

After metric views are deployed and validated, proceed to:
**`semantic-layer/02-databricks-table-valued-functions/SKILL.md`** — Create TVFs for Genie Spaces using the Gold tables referenced by your metric views.
