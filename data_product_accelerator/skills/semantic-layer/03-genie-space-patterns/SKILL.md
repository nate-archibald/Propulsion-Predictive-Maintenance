# Genie Space Patterns

## Overview

This skill provides patterns for setting up production-ready Databricks Genie Spaces with natural language analytics capabilities. The quality of Genie responses directly correlates with the depth of business context provided in agent instructions.

**Core Principle:** Business context drives AI quality. Comprehensive agent instructions, properly selected data assets, and validated benchmark questions ensure reliable Genie performance.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating new Genie Spaces for natural language analytics
- Configuring agent behavior and instructions
- Selecting and organizing data assets (Metric Views, TVFs, Tables)
- Writing benchmark questions for validation
- Troubleshooting Genie query routing issues
- Optimizing Genie Space performance

### 🔀 Hand Off to `genie-space-export-import-api` Skill When:

| User Says / Task Involves | Load Instead |
|---|---|
| "deploy Genie Space via API" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |
| "export Genie Space", "download Genie Space config" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |
| "import Genie Space", "restore Genie Space" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |
| "CI/CD for Genie Spaces" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |

## Upstream: Genie API Updates

The upstream `databricks-genie` skill provides these MCP tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_genie` | List all Genie Spaces accessible to you |
| `create_or_update_genie` | Create or update a Genie Space |
| `get_genie` | Get Genie Space details |
| `delete_genie` | Delete a Genie Space |
| `find_genie_by_name` | Look up a Genie Space by name (when you don't have the space_id) |
| `ask_genie` | Ask a question to a Genie Space, get SQL + results |
| `ask_genie_followup` | Ask follow-up question in existing conversation |

**IMPORTANT:** There is NO system table for Genie spaces (e.g., `system.ai.genie_spaces` does NOT exist). To find a Genie space by name, use the `find_genie_by_name` tool.

---

## Critical Rules

### 1. General Instructions Must Be ≤20 Lines

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Genie processes General Instructions effectively only when ≤20 lines. Longer instructions get truncated or ignored.

**✅ DO:** Keep General Instructions concise and focused on essential routing rules.

**❌ DON'T:** Exceed 20 lines in General Instructions section.

### 2. Benchmark Questions Must Have Working SQL

**Every benchmark question MUST include copy-paste-ready SQL that actually runs.**

**✅ DO:** Include tested SQL with every benchmark question.

**❌ DON'T:** Provide questions without SQL or untested SQL.

**⚠️ Temporal Expression Warning:** Avoid `CURRENT_DATE()`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`, or `DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)` in benchmark SQL. These produce different results each day, making automated regression testing unreliable.

**❌ Fragile (non-deterministic):**
```sql
WHERE transaction_date >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)  -- Different results every day
```

**✅ Stable for regression testing:**
```sql
WHERE transaction_date BETWEEN DATE '2026-01-01' AND DATE '2026-03-31'  -- Pinned date range
```

**Guidance:** Use `CURRENT_DATE - 30` for initial interactive testing, but pin to fixed date ranges (`DATE '...'`) for CI/CD regression suites and benchmark validation scripts.

### 3. MEASURE() Uses Column Names, NOT Display Names

**The MEASURE() function requires actual column `name`, NOT `display_name`.**

**❌ WRONG:**
```sql
MEASURE(`Total Revenue`)  -- ❌ FAILS: "Total Revenue" is display_name
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```sql
MEASURE(total_revenue)  -- ✅ Uses actual column name from YAML
```

**⚠️ Dimension references in metric view queries must use bare names — NOT source/join table prefixes:**

**❌ WRONG:**
```sql
SELECT dim_store.state_name, MEASURE(total_revenue)
FROM ${catalog}.${gold_schema}.revenue_metrics
WHERE dim_store.state_name = 'California'  -- ❌ UNRESOLVED_COLUMN
GROUP BY dim_store.state_name
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```sql
SELECT state_name, MEASURE(total_revenue)
FROM ${catalog}.${gold_schema}.revenue_metrics
WHERE state_name = 'California'  -- ✅ Bare dimension name
GROUP BY state_name
```

Metric views flatten all dimensions into a single namespace. When writing benchmark SQL or General Instructions examples, always use bare dimension names without table prefixes.

### 4. Full UC 3-Part Namespace Required

**All table and function references MUST use full Unity Catalog namespace.**

**❌ WRONG:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM fact_sales;
SELECT * FROM get_revenue_by_period('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31', 'week');
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM ${catalog}.${gold_schema}.fact_sales;
SELECT * FROM ${catalog}.${gold_schema}.get_revenue_by_period('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31', 'week');
```

### 5. Data Asset Hierarchy: Metric Views → TVFs → Tables

**Always add assets in this order:**

1. **Metric Views** (Primary - use first)
   - Pre-aggregated, optimized, rich semantics
   - Best for broad analytical queries

2. **TVFs** (Secondary - use for specific patterns)
   - Parameterized queries, business logic
   - Date-bounded queries, top N rankings

3. **Tables** (Last resort - use sparingly)
   - Only when metric views/TVFs insufficient
   - Reference data, ad-hoc exploration

### 6. Avoid Contradictory Routing Rules

**Issue:** Contradictory rules cause Genie to randomly select wrong assets.

**✅ DO:** Group by question type, not asset
```markdown
Revenue/booking questions:
  - By property → revenue_analytics_metrics
  - By host → get_host_performance TVF (not metric view!)
```

**❌ DON'T:** Create conflicting asset mappings
```markdown
- host_analytics_metrics → for host data
- get_host_performance → for host data  # ❌ CONFLICT!
```

### 7. Define Ambiguous Terms Explicitly

**Common ambiguous terms:** "underperforming", "top performing", "valuable customers", "best hosts"

**✅ DO:** Add explicit definitions
```markdown
## Term Definitions
"underperforming" = properties with revenue below median (use get_underperforming_properties TVF)
"top performing" = highest revenue unless "rated" specified
```

### 8. TVF Syntax Rules

**Common errors to prevent:**

**❌ WRONG:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE(get_customer_segments(...))  -- ❌ Don't wrap in TABLE()
SELECT * FROM get_customer_segments()            -- ❌ Missing parameters
SELECT * FROM get_customer_segments(...) GROUP BY segment  -- ❌ Unnecessary GROUP BY
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_customer_segments('2020-01-01', '2024-12-31')  -- ✅ Direct call with params
```

### 9. 🔴 MANDATORY: Serverless SQL Warehouse Only

**ALWAYS assign a Serverless SQL Warehouse to Genie Spaces. NEVER use Classic or Pro warehouses.**

Serverless provides auto-scaling, instant startup, and cost-efficient idle timedowns -- critical for interactive Genie sessions where users expect sub-10-second responses.

**❌ WRONG:** Classic SQL warehouse with manual cluster sizing.

**✅ CORRECT:** Serverless SQL warehouse (auto-detected or explicitly set).

### 10. Table/Column COMMENTs Are Genie Fuel

**Genie uses Unity Catalog TABLE and COLUMN comments to understand data.** Missing comments = degraded SQL generation quality.

**🔴 MANDATORY:** Before adding ANY table as a trusted asset, verify it has:
- `COMMENT ON TABLE` with a business-friendly description
- `COMMENT ON COLUMN` for every column, including dimension values and business context

See [Table Documentation Skill](../../gold/design-workers/06-table-documentation/SKILL.md) for comment standards.

**❌ WRONG:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (sale_id BIGINT, amt DECIMAL(18,2));  -- No comments, cryptic names
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (
  sale_id BIGINT COMMENT 'Unique sale identifier from POS system',
  total_amount DECIMAL(18,2) COMMENT 'Net sale amount in USD after discounts'
) COMMENT 'Daily retail sales transactions at store-SKU grain';
```

### 11. Pre-Creation Table Inspection Is Mandatory

**Before creating a Genie Space, ALWAYS inspect target table schemas.** Do not rely on assumed schemas.

1. Run `DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED` or use `get_table_details` for each trusted asset
2. Verify all tables have TABLE and COLUMN comments
3. Verify descriptive column names (use `customer_lifetime_value` NOT `clv`)
4. Verify proper data types (DATE columns for time-based queries)

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#pre-creation-table-inspection) for the full inspection checklist.

### 12. Prompt User for Benchmark Questions Before Generating

**Always ask the user for benchmark questions before generating synthetic ones.** User-provided questions reflect real business needs and catch domain-specific edge cases that synthetic generation misses.

**Three outcomes:**
- **User provides 10+:** Validate each one. Report any that can't be answered (missing table, ambiguous terms). Proceed with valid set.
- **User provides 1-9:** Validate provided, report issues, augment with synthetic to reach 10-15 total. Show augmentation to user.
- **User provides none:** Generate 10-15 synthetic benchmarks from asset metadata. Show to user for review.

**If a user question can't be answered**, do NOT silently drop it. Inform the user with the specific reason:
- "Table `X` is not a trusted asset in this space"
- "No data available for churn analysis — available domains are: revenue, bookings, property performance"
- "Term 'underperforming' is ambiguous — how should it be defined?"

See [Benchmark Intake Workflow](references/benchmark-intake-workflow.md) for the full validation and generation pipeline.

### 13. Validate Programmatically via Conversation API

**After deployment, test benchmark questions programmatically using the Conversation API -- not just the UI.**

```python
# ✅ Programmatic validation (reproducible, automated)
result = ask_genie(space_id="your_space_id", question="What were total sales last month?")
assert result["status"] == "COMPLETED"
assert result["row_count"] > 0
```

**Key rules:**
- Start a NEW conversation for each unrelated benchmark question
- Use `ask_genie_followup` ONLY for related follow-up questions within the same topic
- Set timeouts: simple queries (30s), complex joins (60-120s), large scans (120s+)

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#conversation-api-validation) for full testing patterns.

### 14. Extended Instructions Must Follow the 13-Section Structure

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** For domains beyond simple use cases, structure Extended Instructions into these 13 mandatory sections:

**PURPOSE → ASSET ROUTING → BUSINESS DEFINITIONS → DISAMBIGUATION → AGGREGATION RULES → FUNCTION ROUTING → JOIN GUIDANCE → QUERY RULES → QUERY PATTERNS → TEMPORAL FILTERS → DATA QUALITY NOTES → CONSTRAINTS → SQL EXPRESSIONS**

Each section serves a distinct purpose for Genie's SQL generation. Missing sections (especially ASSET ROUTING, DISAMBIGUATION, and BUSINESS DEFINITIONS) are the top causes of misrouted queries. Section 13 (SQL EXPRESSIONS) documents which concepts to promote into structured `sql_snippets`.

**✅ DO:** Follow the 13-section template in [Agent Instructions Guide](references/agent-instructions.md#the-13-mandatory-sections).

**❌ DON'T:** Write instructions as an unstructured wall of text or a flat numbered list without section headers.

### 15. Column Configs Require Genie-Specific Flags

**Every column_config entry should include `enable_format_assistance` and/or `enable_entity_matching` flags based on column type.**

| Column Type | enable_format_assistance | enable_entity_matching |
|---|---|---|
| Dimension text/name | ✅ | ✅ |
| Categorical flag (Y/N) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Date/timestamp | ✅ | ❌ |
| Numeric ID | ✅ | ❌ |
| Numeric measure | ❌ | ❌ |

See [Agent Instructions Guide](references/agent-instructions.md#column-config-flags-for-genie) for the full pattern.

### 16. Synonyms Go in Column Configs, Not Table COMMENTs

**Synonyms belong in Genie Space `column_configs[].synonyms` or metric view YAML `synonyms` fields.** Never embed synonyms in Unity Catalog TABLE or COLUMN COMMENT strings.

- UC COMMENTs → business definitions, grain, valid values
- column_configs synonyms → user-friendly alternative names for NLQ matching

### 17. Append Instructions When Optimizing — Never Replace

**When optimizing an existing Genie Space, APPEND new rules to the existing instruction block. NEVER replace the entire block.**

Existing rules were validated against benchmarks. Replacing them risks regression on questions that currently work. See [Agent Instructions Guide](references/agent-instructions.md#instruction-evolution-append-only-updates).

### 18. Validate Programmatically via Conversation API

**After deployment, test benchmark questions programmatically using the Conversation API — not just the UI.**

```python
result = ask_genie(space_id="your_space_id", question="What were total sales last month?")
assert result["status"] == "COMPLETED"
assert result["row_count"] > 0
```

**Key rules:**
- Start a NEW conversation for each unrelated benchmark question
- Use `ask_genie_followup` ONLY for related follow-up questions within the same topic
- Set timeouts: simple queries (30s), complex joins (60-120s), large scans (120s+)

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#conversation-api-validation) for full testing patterns.

### 19. SQL Expressions Provide Structured Business Concept Definitions

**SQL Expressions (`sql_snippets` in the API) give Genie structured, parseable definitions of measures, filters, and dimensions.** Unlike text instructions (free-form) and example SQL queries (full query templates), SQL expressions define **individual reusable concepts** that Genie can match directly to user questions.

| Type | JSON Key | SQL Requirement | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Measure** | `measures` | Aggregation function | `SUM(table.total_sales_usd)` |
| **Filter** | `filters` | Boolean condition | `table.country_code = 'US'` |
| **Dimension** | `expressions` | Column reference or derivation (no aggregation) | `table.zone_combination` |

**When to use SQL Expressions:**
- KPIs that users ask about frequently (promote from BUSINESS DEFINITIONS)
- Common WHERE clauses that appear in 3+ benchmark queries (promote from AGGREGATION RULES)
- Grouping attributes with synonyms (promote from DISAMBIGUATION section)

**Every SQL Expression MUST include:**
- `display_name`: User-friendly name shown in Genie UI
- `sql`: Working SQL fragment referencing trusted asset `table.column`
- `synonyms`: 2-5 alternative terms users might use
- `instruction`: When and how Genie should apply this expression

**SQL Expressions complement text instructions — they do NOT replace them.** Text instructions provide routing logic and disambiguation context. SQL expressions provide structured, matchable KPI/filter/dimension definitions. Use both together.

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#section-h-sql-expressions) for JSON schema, examples, and the "promote" pattern.

### 20. Validate Benchmark SQL Dialect (Databricks SQL Only)

LLMs trained on multi-dialect SQL corpora often generate Oracle/Postgres/T-SQL syntax in benchmark SQL. Scan ALL benchmark and sql_snippet SQL for these common traps:

| Wrong (Oracle/Postgres/T-SQL) | Correct (Databricks SQL) |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `TRUNC(date, 'quarter')` | `DATE_TRUNC('quarter', date)` |
| `SYSDATE` | `CURRENT_DATE()` |
| `NVL(x, y)` | `COALESCE(x, y)` |
| `DATEADD(day, -30, date)` | `DATE_ADD(date, -30)` |
| `DATEDIFF(day, d1, d2)` | `DATEDIFF(d2, d1)` |
| `TO_DATE('...')` | `CAST('...' AS DATE)` |

See [Troubleshooting Guide](references/troubleshooting.md#sql-dialect-errors) for the full dialect reference.

## Quick Reference

### Mandatory 8-Section Structure

Every Genie Space setup MUST produce a document with ALL 8 sections:

| Section | Requirement | Key Constraint |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **A. Space Name** | `{Project} {Domain} Analytics Space` | Exact format |
| **B. Space Description** | 2-3 sentences | Business context |
| **C. Sample Questions** | 10-15 questions | Grouped by domain |
| **D. Data Assets** | All tables & metric views | Table format |
| **E. General Instructions** | **≤20 LINES** | **CRITICAL LIMIT** |
| **F. TVFs** | All functions with signatures | Detailed specs |
| **G. Benchmark Questions** | 10-15 with **EXACT SQL** | Working SQL required |
| **H. SQL Expressions** | Measures, Filters, Dimensions | Structured `sql_snippets` |

**🔴 Missing any section = INCOMPLETE deliverable. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

---

## Core Setup Pattern

### Step 1: Create Space Document Structure

Follow the mandatory 8-section structure (A-H). Use the [configuration template](assets/templates/genie-space-config.yaml) as a starting point.

### Step 2: Write General Instructions (≤20 Lines)

Use the template from [Agent Instructions Guide](references/agent-instructions.md#general-instructions-mandatory-20-lines):

```markdown
## General Instructions

You are an expert {domain} analyst. Follow these rules:

1. **Primary Data Source:** Always use Metric Views first
2. **Use TVFs:** For common queries, prefer Table-Valued Functions
3. **Date Defaults:** If no date specified, default to last 30 days
4. **Aggregations:** Use SUM for totals, AVG for averages
5. **Sorting:** Sort by primary metric DESC unless specified
6. **Limits:** Return top 10-20 rows for ranking queries
7. **Currency:** Format as USD with 2 decimal places
8. **Percentages:** Show as % with 1 decimal place
9. **Synonyms:** Handle common term equivalents
10. **Context:** Explain results in business terms
11. **Comparisons:** Show absolute values and % difference
12. **Time Periods:** Support today, yesterday, last week, month, quarter, YTD
13. **Null Handling:** Exclude nulls from calculations
14. **Performance:** Never scan raw Bronze/Silver tables
15. **Accuracy:** State assumptions when uncertain
```

### Step 3: Document Data Assets

Add assets in order: Metric Views → TVFs → Tables. Document each with:
- **Metric Views:** Measures, dimensions, use cases
- **TVFs:** Signature, parameters, return schema, use cases
- **Tables:** Purpose, when to use

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#section-d-data-assets) for detailed patterns.

### Step 3b: Define SQL Expressions

After documenting data assets, identify key business concepts to register as structured SQL Expressions (`sql_snippets`). These give Genie parseable definitions it can match directly against user questions.

**Promote from text instructions:**
1. **Top KPIs** (from BUSINESS DEFINITIONS) → `measures` with aggregation SQL and synonyms
2. **Common WHERE clauses** (from AGGREGATION RULES) → `filters` with boolean SQL and synonyms
3. **Key grouping attributes** (from DISAMBIGUATION) → `expressions` (dimensions) with column SQL and synonyms

**UI terminology → JSON key mapping:**

| Databricks UI | JSON key in `sql_snippets` |
|---|---|
| Measure | `measures` |
| Filter | `filters` |
| Dimension | `expressions` |

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#section-h-sql-expressions) for JSON schema, field requirements, and build script patterns.

### Step 4: Write Benchmark Questions (Interactive Intake)

Benchmark questions validate that Genie routes correctly and generates accurate SQL. **Always prompt the user for their questions first before generating synthetic ones.**

#### Three-Path Workflow

| User Provides | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| **10+ questions** | Validate each against available assets. Report any that can't be answered (missing table, ambiguous terms, need more info). Proceed with valid set. |
| **1-9 questions** | Validate provided questions. Report issues. Augment with synthetic benchmarks to reach 10-15 total. |
| **No questions** | Generate 10-15 synthetic benchmarks from metric view measures, TVF signatures, and table schemas. Show to user for review. |

#### Validation Rules for User-Submitted Questions

For each submitted question, verify:

| Check | What to Verify | If Failed, Tell the User |
|-------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Asset coverage** | At least one MV/TVF/table can answer it | "No asset in this space can answer '{question}'. Available domains: {list}." |
| **Table existence** | SQL only references trusted assets | "SQL references `{table}` which isn't a trusted asset." |
| **MEASURE() columns** | Column names match actual MV columns | "MEASURE({col}) doesn't match any column. Available: {list}." |
| **UC namespace** | SQL uses `${catalog}.${gold_schema}.{object}` | "SQL must use full 3-part UC namespace." |
| **TVF parameters** | All required parameters present | "TVF `{name}` requires: {params}. Missing: {missing}." |
| **Ambiguous terms** | Terms like "underperforming", "top" are defined | "What does '{term}' mean here? Revenue? Ratings? Bookings?" |

**If a question cannot be answered** (missing table, no matching data), inform the user with the specific reason and suggest alternatives based on available assets.

**If a question needs clarification** (ambiguous terms, missing time range), ask the user to clarify before including it.

#### Synthetic Generation (When User Provides None or Few)

Generate benchmarks from available asset metadata:
1. **From Metric Views** — one aggregation question per measure, one grouped question per dimension
2. **From TVFs** — one question per function matching its use case (ranking, time-series, detail)
3. **From Tables** — list/detail questions for dimension tables (only if needed to fill gaps)
4. **Category coverage** — ensure at least 4 categories: aggregation, ranking, time-series, comparison, list

After generation, **show the synthetic benchmarks to the user** for review before proceeding.

#### Augmentation (When User Provides Partial Set)

When augmenting user-provided questions:
1. **User questions always take priority** — never replace them
2. **Fill category gaps first** — if user only provided aggregation questions, add ranking/time-series/list
3. **Add synonym variations** — test Genie handles "total spend" vs "how much spent" vs "total costs"
4. **Add date variations** — "this month" vs "last 30 days" vs "Q1 2026"
5. **Cap at 15 total** — user questions + synthetic augmentation

See [Benchmark Intake Workflow](references/benchmark-intake-workflow.md) for the full validation pipeline, generation patterns, and augmentation strategy.

#### Output Format for Each Benchmark

Every question must include:
- Natural language question
- Expected SQL (tested and working)
- Expected result description

**⚠️ JSON field name:** In the API-compatible JSON export, benchmark SQL goes in `answer: [{format: "SQL", content: ["SELECT ..."]}]` — **NOT** in a field called `expected_sql`. The term "Expected SQL" here refers to the content, not the JSON field name. See `genie-space-export-import-api` for the exact `BenchmarkQuestion` schema.

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#section-g-benchmark-questions) for format.

### Step 5: Deploy and Test

**Choose your deployment path:**

| Method | When to Use | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| **UI** | One-off setup, manual curation | This skill (continue below) |
| **REST API / CI/CD** | Automated deployment, cross-workspace migration, version control | **Load [`genie-space-export-import-api`](../genie-space-export-import-api/SKILL.md)** |

**UI deployment steps:**
1. Inspect all target table schemas (verify comments, column names, data types)
2. Create Genie Space in Databricks UI with **Serverless SQL Warehouse**
3. Add trusted assets in order (Metric Views → TVFs → Tables). **Production: Gold layer only.** **Workshop deployments** may reference Silver/Bronze directly — Genie will work, but accuracy is typically lower because raw layers usually lack curated COMMENTs and dimensional joins. Promote to Gold for production hardening.
4. Set General Instructions (copy exactly, verify ≤20 lines)
5. Test benchmark questions **programmatically** via Conversation API
6. Validate routing, response quality, and follow-up context

**API deployment steps:** Load the `genie-space-export-import-api` skill for:
- JSON schema structure (`serialized_space` format)
- Template variable substitution (`${catalog}`, `${gold_schema}`)
- Asset inventory-driven generation (prevents "table doesn't exist" errors)
- Export/import scripts (`export_genie_space.py`, `import_genie_space.py`)

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#deployment-checklist) for complete steps.

## Post-Deployment Configuration Audit

Genie Spaces drift in production — UI edits change instructions, assets are added/removed manually, benchmark questions get deleted. Use a version-controlled audit workflow to detect drift.

### Audit Workflow

1. **Export live config:** Use the Genie API to export the current space as JSON (`GET /api/2.0/genie/spaces/{space_id}`)
2. **Diff against source:** Compare the exported JSON to the version-controlled config in `src/{project}_semantic/genie_configs/`
3. **Report drift:** Flag any differences in trusted assets, instructions, sample questions, or warehouse assignment
4. **Remediate:** Either update the source JSON (if the UI changes were intentional) or re-deploy from source (if unintentional)

### What to Audit

| Check | How to Detect | Severity |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Trusted assets changed | Diff `data_sources` array in exported JSON | 🔴 High — affects query routing |
| General Instructions edited past 20 lines | Count lines in `instructions.text` | 🔴 High — causes instruction truncation |
| Benchmark questions removed | Diff `benchmarks` array | 🟡 Medium — reduces validation coverage |
| SQL Expressions modified | Diff `instructions.sql_snippets` | 🔴 High — affects KPI/filter matching |
| Warehouse changed to non-Serverless | Check `warehouse_id` type | 🔴 High — degrades interactive performance |
| Sample questions modified | Diff `config.sample_questions` | 🟢 Low — cosmetic impact |

### Audit Cadence

| Environment | Cadence | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Development | After each manual UI edit | Manual |
| Staging | Before promotion to production | CI/CD gate |
| Production | Weekly | Scheduled |

Use `scripts/audit_genie_space.py` for automated detection. See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#post-deployment-audit) for detailed patterns.

## Cross-Consumer Design Considerations

Genie Spaces don't exist in isolation — the same Metric Views and TVFs often feed AI/BI dashboards, notebooks, and Power BI. Design assets with all consumers in mind.

### Genie vs Dashboard Consumption Patterns

| Consumer | How It Uses Metric Views | Design Implication |
|----------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Genie / ad-hoc SQL** | `MEASURE(ratio_metric)` — context-aware | Composed ratios work directly |
| **Dashboard KPI counters** | `MEASURE(ratio_metric)` — single value | Composed ratios work directly |
| **Dashboard pivot tables** | Raw dataset rows with widget-level aggregation | Requires additive components (numerator + denominator as separate measures) |
| **Dashboard flat tables** | Either pattern | No special handling needed |

### Key Design Rule

When a Metric View serves both Genie and dashboard pivot tables, always define **both** the composed ratio AND the additive components:

```yaml
measures:
  # Additive components (consumed by dashboard pivots)
  - name: total_sales
    expr: SUM(source.net_sales_usd)
  - name: store_day_count
    expr: SUM(source.store_day_count)

  # Composed ratio (consumed by Genie, KPI widgets)
  - name: avg_sales_per_store_day
    expr: MEASURE(total_sales) / NULLIF(MEASURE(store_day_count), 0)
```

### Asset Naming for Cross-Consumer Use

- Use consistent naming across Metric View YAML `name` fields and Genie Space data asset documentation
- Genie relies on `synonyms` for NLQ matching — keep these in `column_configs` or YAML, not in UC COMMENTs
- Dashboard pivot widgets use the column `name` directly — ensure they are human-readable (`total_revenue`, not `rev_tot`)

### Geographic Dimensions for Downstream Dashboards

If Metric View dimensions will be used in Lakeview choropleth map widgets, use full geographic names (e.g., `state_name: "California"`, not `state_abbr: "CA"`). Mapbox geographic roles require full text names. Apply a CASE expression in the upstream Gold MV or metric view if source data uses abbreviations.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| General Instructions > 20 lines | Genie won't process effectively past 20 lines |
| Benchmark questions without SQL | Cannot validate Genie responses |
| Display names in MEASURE() | Requires actual column names from YAML |
| Partial UC namespaces | Always use full 3-part: `${catalog}.${schema}.{object}` |
| Only tables as trusted assets | Start with Metric Views for better performance |
| Contradictory routing rules | Group by question type, not asset |
| Undefined ambiguous terms | Define "underperforming", "top performing" explicitly |
| Incorrect TVF syntax | No TABLE() wrapper, include all params, no extra GROUP BY |
| Classic/Pro SQL Warehouse | ALWAYS use Serverless (fast startup, auto-scaling) |
| Tables without comments | Genie uses UC metadata; missing = worse SQL |
| Cryptic column names (`clv`) | Use descriptive (`customer_lifetime_value`) for accuracy |
| Skipping table inspection | DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED before adding assets |
| UI-only testing | Validate programmatically via Conversation API |
| Reusing conversations across topics | New conversation per topic; `ask_genie_followup` only for related |
| Silver/Bronze as trusted assets in **production** Genie Spaces | Gold layer only for production — Silver/Bronze typically lack curated COMMENTs and dimensional joins required for high-quality NL accuracy. **Workshop mode** may deploy Genie Spaces directly on Silver/Bronze with a quality advisory; this is allowed for enablement and prototyping, but promote to Gold before going to production. |
| Unstructured instruction wall of text | Use the 13-section structure (PURPOSE through SQL EXPRESSIONS) |
| Missing DISAMBIGUATION section | Ambiguous columns (e.g., zone_name vs zone_combination) cause wrong GROUP BY |
| Replacing entire instruction block during optimization | Append new rules; replacement risks regression on validated benchmarks |
| Synonyms embedded in UC COMMENTs | Synonyms go in column_configs or metric view YAML — not in COMMENTs |
| Missing enable_format_assistance / enable_entity_matching | These flags significantly improve Genie's entity matching and formatting |
| KPI definitions only in text instructions | Also register as `sql_snippets.measures` for structured Genie matching |
| Filter SQL that isn't boolean | `sql_snippets.filters` must evaluate to boolean (e.g., `table.col = 'value'`) |
| Dimension SQL with aggregation | `sql_snippets.expressions` must be per-row (column reference or CASE WHEN), never `SUM`/`AVG` |
| Missing synonyms on SQL Expressions | Synonyms are how Genie matches user terms to expressions; without them, matching fails |
| SQL Expressions referencing non-trusted tables | `sql` field must reference tables in `data_sources.tables[].identifier` |

## Genie Space Notes to Carry Forward

After completing Genie Space configuration, carry these notes to the next worker:
- **Genie Space names and JSON paths:** List of all configured spaces with their JSON config file paths
- **Asset assignments per space:** Which Metric Views, TVFs, and Gold Tables are assigned to each space
- **Benchmark question counts:** Number of benchmark questions per space (minimum 10 required)
- **Warehouse assignment:** SQL Warehouse ID assigned to each space
- **Space IDs (if deployed):** Genie Space IDs returned from API creation (needed for idempotent re-deployment)
- **Template variables used:** Confirm `${catalog}` and `${gold_schema}` are used for portability

## Next Step

After Genie Space JSON configs are generated, proceed to:
**`semantic-layer/04-genie-space-export-import-api/SKILL.md`** — If deploying via REST API (recommended for cross-environment promotion). Otherwise, proceed to Phase 4 (Asset Bundle Configuration) in the orchestrator.
