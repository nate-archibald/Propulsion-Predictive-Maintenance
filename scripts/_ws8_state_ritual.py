"""WS8b one-off: make the vibecoding-state enter/exit pair LOAD-BEARING across
every track fork (lakehouse / apps / agents).

Two mechanical edits, both idempotent:
  1. Every fork that already carries a `**State-lock:**` line gets a verify-write
     ritual + hard Gate-completion rule appended to that line, with the correct
     canonical state path for its track.
  2. The two design/plan forks that used `resolve_root` (gold_layer_design,
     usecase_plan) are converted to `enter`/`exit` and given a State-lock line so
     their state actually persists. gold_layer_design (the FIRST data-product
     step) bootstrap-creates the canonical DP state file.

Track -> canonical live state file:
  lakehouse -> <dp_bundle_root>/.vibecoding-state.md
  apps      -> <app_root>/.vibecoding-state.md
  agents    -> <agent_app_root>/.vibecoding-state.md
